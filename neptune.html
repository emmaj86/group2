        <h1 style="color: #79B4FC" class="page-info-title">Neptune</h1>
        <img class="left" src="images/PlanetsImages/neptune.jpeg" alt="Planet Neptune" width="700" height="500" />
        <p class="page-info-copy">Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar
            System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
            planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is
            denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of
            its atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being
            its near-twin Uranus). <br> <br>

            Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined "solid surface." The planet orbits the
            Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named
            after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident. <br><br>

            Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical
            prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis
            Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After
            Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch
            Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by
            Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was
            discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located
            telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size,
            making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew
            by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. The
            advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently
            allowed for additional detailed observations from afar. <br> <br>

            Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with
            traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as
            water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and
            rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. Traces
            of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance, though an unknown
            component is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to Uranus.</p>
