        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large
            amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About
            71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining
            29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of
            several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
            Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting
            destructive solar winds.

            Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions
            than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely present
            in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like
            carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. A region's climate is
            governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as
            tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

            Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.
            Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from
            the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around
            its own axis in just less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted
            with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited
            by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is
            roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking
            and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

            Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed
            and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface,
            leading to Earth's Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have
            reached a population of almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for
            their survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's
            climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening people's lives and causing widespread
            extinction of other life.</p>
