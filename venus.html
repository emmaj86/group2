        <h1 style="color: #FFD0C0" class="page-info-title">Venus</h1>
        <img class="left" src="images/PlanetsImages/venus.jpeg" alt="Planet Venus" width="700" height="500" />
        <p class="page-info-copy">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love
            and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and
            can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus' orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but
            its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a day-night cycle, it is most readily visible for up
            to a few hours following the start of sunset or before sunrise. At times, it has been seen in a completely
            dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and
            a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than
            any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means
            that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east. Venus does not have any moons, a
            distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System. <br> <br>

            The third smallest planet in the Solar System, Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's
            "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is
            radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial
            planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is
            about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on
            Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar
            System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly
            reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may have
            had water oceans in the past, but after these evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway
            greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
            interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field. Because of the
            lethal surface conditions, the planet is sometimes referred to as Earth's "evil twin". <br> <br>

            As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as
            records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures and has been a prime inspiration for
            writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions
            plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BCE</p>
